"""
Oscillator-based speech syllabification algorithm (Räsänen et al., 2015, 2018).

Based on the papers:

- O. J. Räsänen, G. Doyle, and M. C. Frank, "Unsupervised word discovery from
  speech using automatic segmentation into syllable-like units," in Proc.
  Interspeech, 2015.
- O. J. Räsänen, G. Doyle, and M. C. Frank, "Pre-linguistic segmentation of
  speech into syllable-like units," Cognition, 2018.

This is a derivation of Adriana Stan's Python implementation available at
https://github.com/speech-utcluj/thetaOscillator-syllable-segmentation. I
modified the code:

- To make it stand as an importable package.
- Removed Matlab-like syntax (semicolons and % comments).
- Updated `peakdet()` to use the correct Python 3syntaxt, which addressed
  deprecation warnings.
- Fixed a bug where `len(env)` was used instead of `env.shape[1]`, resulting in
  the wrong boundaries being returned for very short utterances.
